# Accelerate - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations
### by Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim


## Message
Organization performance is affected by continuous integration & delivery, architecture, product & process, lean practices and culture.

## Chapters
### Chapter 1 - Accelerate
Use small teams. Support the teams at an **organizational** level. Use DevOps principles.

### Chapter 2 - Measuring Performance
The performance of the delivery can be assessed by:
  
Deployment Frequency - how frequently you release.
  
Lead time - how long it takes for those changes to go from ideation to customer
  
Mean time to recovery - how quickly you can restore failures 
  
Change failure rate - how often you introduce failures to production

### Chapter 3 - Measuring and Changing Culture
Organizations should encourage a culture of **trust**, shared responsibility, allow failure, innovation, and collaboration.

### Chapter 4 - Technical Practices
Have CI&CD. Release in small, fast, incremental loops.
Empowered, automated, and high-quality software teams.

### Chapter 5 - Architecture
Loosely-coupled, testable architecture. Prefer independent and efficient delivery of the business outcomes, over tools and tech.

### Chapter 6 - Integrating Infosec into the Delivery Lifecycle
Move security to the beginning of and throughout development.

### Chapter 7 - Management Practices for Software
Create an environment of high collaboration, low dependencies between the dev teams.

The goal of leadership is to provide the governance to drive culture and support software delivery performance — providing the tools, coaching, goal setting, and metrics and monitoring to enable self-organizing and empowered teams. 

Lean management:
* Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
* Visual Management
* Feedback from Production
* Lightweight Change Approvals

### Chapter 8 - Product Development
Embrace and adopt lean practices - move through the product lifecycle quickly in a fast, and visible manner.

Lean Product Development:
* Work in Small Batches
* Make Flow of Work Visible
* Gather and Implement Customer Feedback
* Team Experimentation

### Chapter 9 - Making Work Sustainable
Reduce deployment pain. Do Continuous Deployment.
Claimed organization values should align with the actual, lived values.

### Chapter 10 - Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement
Provide employees clear vision and goals.  
Increase a culture of experimentation and learning.  
Increase staff diversity and inclusion.  

### Chapter 11 - Leaders and Managers
Hire & train leader managers who develop and retain talents while removing impediments in their way.

Five Characteristics of a transformational leader:

* Vision. Has a clear understanding of where the organization is going and where it should be in five years.
* Inspirational communication. Communicates in a way that inspires and motivates, even in an uncertain or changing environment.
* Intellectual stimulation. Challenges followers to think about problems in new ways.
* Supportive leadership. Demonstrates care and consideration of followers’ personal needs and feelings.
* Personal recognition. Praises and acknowledges achievement of goals and improvements in work quality; personally compliments others when they do outstanding work.

## Some Takeouts

**None of these factors predicts performance**
* Age and technology used for the application (for example, mainframe “systems of record” vs. greenfield “systems of engagement”)
* Whether operations teams or development teams performed deployments
* Whether a change approval board (CAB) is implemented

\
\___

High utilization is only good up to a point. Once utilization gets above a certain level, there is no spare capacity (or “slack”) to absorb unplanned work, changes to the plan, or improvement work.
In other words, once you get to very high levels of utilization, it takes teams exponentially longer to get anything done.

\
\___

**Software Delivery Performance**
* Change Lead Time - Time to implement, test, and deliver code for a feature (measured from first commit to deployment)
* Deployment Frequency - Number of deployments in a given duration of time
* Change Failure Rate - Percentage of failed changes over all changes (regardless of success)
* Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) - Time it takes to restore service after production failure

\
\___

Best performing teams depend not only on talents but on how team members interact, structure their work, view their contributions. I.e., team dynamics.

\
\___

> Where code deployments are most painful, you’ll find the poorest software delivery performance, organizational performance, and culture.

**Ron Westrum’s Organizational Typology**
* **Pathological** (power-oriented) organizations are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better.
* **Bureaucratic** (rule-oriented) organizations protect departments. Those in the department want to maintain their “turf,” insist on their own rules, and generally do things by the book—their book.
* **Generative** (performance-oriented) organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to do.
