# Never Split the Difference - Negotiating as If Your Life Depended on It
### Chris Voss and Tahl Raz

People often settle for less than they want because it seems convenient, or they get frustrated. Both behaviors are unhealthy in private and business relationships alike. 
Negotiation is the only good way to navigate conflict.


Humans are, fundamentally, irrational.
Negotiation by "tactical empathy" - understanding your counterpart's deeper motivations. The trick is to make your opponents feel that they came up with your desired solution, giving them the illusion of control.     

Ask open-ended questions to assess people's motives. Use proper sequence and with the correct tone and **clear interest in the answers**. It will help to build trust and understanding.

To anticipate potential criticism the other party might have against you, perform an **"accusation audit"** before a negotiation. Acknowledging these "accusations" at the beginning of the encounter can build trust and credibility.

**Listen** and notice nonverbal clues like body language and facial expressions.  
Focus on the person and let them feel safe and talk openly. Find out what their real **need**. No quick solution, take your time.
Be humble and considerate, yet firm and uncompromising. Assume best intentions.

**Mirroring** - repeating the last few words the other party said, usually in a question form.  
Use late-night DJ voice; start with "I'm sorry..."; Mirror;silence; repeat.  

**Labeling** - identify and say the emotion that the other party seems to be experiencing, gets you close to them.
Labels begin with: "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "It looks like...".  


Pushing hard for "Yes" doesn’t get a negotiator any closer to a win.
Ask solution-based questions: "What about this doesn't work for you?", "What would you need to make it work?", "It seems like there's something here that bothers you.".  
"Have you given up on this project?" works wonders.
